# Project Nvidia - Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

## Data Mining and Machine Learning - University of Lausanne

### :pencil: Project description

In this project we are challenged to build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about real disasters and which are not. The
project topic is based around a Kaggle competition. We have a training set with 6471 tweets and the information of it is a real disaster or a fake news. The goal is to train this model to have the best accuracy we can on the test set that is located on [AICROWD](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/final-project-of-the-data-mining-and-machine-learning-course). Each teams can make up to 5 submission a day and then see it's accuracy and it's ranking. We can see the results of our fellow and makes the challenge even more competitive!

### :books: Data
You can find the training data and the unlabelled test data under the Resources tab.
Submissions
As you build your model and train it on the training data, you can generate predictions for the
(unlabelled) test data. Make sure that your submission file has the same format as the example
submission file on the Resources tab. Once you are sure about your model and satisfied with the
prediction accuracy you got (on your own test data), you can try to generate predictions for the
actual test data and submit in the compet
In the readme.md you should a) mention the team name, b) describe the project c) your solution
and some results (using figures). d) include also a link to the video that showcases your solution.

A. What is the baserate of the problem
B. A table with all of the classification techniques that we saw in the class (logistic regression,
kNN, Decision trees,â€¦), the parameters used and the achieved accuracy.
C. Your progression of accuracies in a graph, and which technique (with what parameters)
achieved it.
